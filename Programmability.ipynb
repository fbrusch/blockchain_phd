The answer is that the mechanism allows me to take a transaction, split it arbitrarily in n _output transactions_, and then transfer ownership to different accounts. Then I can take my 10 bitcoins, split it into 2 outputs (X and Y) worth 5 each, and transfer X to the recipient, and send Y back to me. \n",
